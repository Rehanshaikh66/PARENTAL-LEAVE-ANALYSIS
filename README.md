## Problem & background
Parental leave policies play a crucial role in supporting the well-being of employees and promoting work-life balance. However, there are disparities in the distribution of leaves between genders and industries. The analysis of parental leave data reveals that there is a significant difference in the allocation of leaves between paid and unpaid, as well as between maternity and paternity leave.To find companies that offer most paid parental leave ,Is maternity leave longer than paternity, distribution of parental leave weeks and noticeable Difference in companies.It is a big Project Completed   on the Basis of Strategic Analysis

## Solution
According to the data, 58% of companies provide paid maternity leave, while 33% offer
unpaid maternity leave.This discrepancy suggests a heavier focus on mothers
rather than fathers.


In contrast, only 7% of companies provide paid paternity leave, and a mere 2% offer unpaid paternity leave.This discrepancy suggests an imbalance in the support provided to new parents


Now,The data indicates that maternity leaves tend to be longer than paternity leaves. Approximately 94% of companies provide longer maternity leaves, while only 6% offer comparable durations for paternity leaves. This  raises concerns about gender equality & equal distribution of caregiving responsibilities.


Among the industries analyzed, the technology sector stands out, offering 6741.5 Which is the highest number of parental leave policies compared to other industries.


Additionally,the analysis reveals that Out of  100%, 70% of Companies are recognized for their  parental leave policies, providing 52 weeks of leave to their employees & 30% of Companies are recognized for their parental leave policies, providing  more than 52 Weeks of leave to their employees


## Methodology & Project scope
1. Our primary objective is to streamline the process of understanding parental leave policies. We will collect data from a diverse range of companies across industries. The data will be gathered from four distinct tables and consolidated into a single Excel spreadsheet. This approach simplifies data management and enhances clarity.

2. Once the data is consolidated, we will closely examine the combined dataset. We aim to identify recurring patterns and relationships among different variables. This step is crucial in uncovering insightful observations that shed light on how different factors relate to one another in parental leave policies.
  
3. To facilitate more advanced data analysis, we will create new worksheets within the same Excel file. These worksheets will leverage pivot tables and various Excel functions to effectively organize and summarize the data. This ensures that our analysis is rigorous and comprehensive.
 

4. To enhance the presentation of our analysis, we will employ pivot charts, which are graphical representations generated from pivot tables. These charts will provide visual clarity to our findings, making it easier for stakeholders to grasp and interpret the data-driven insights.


5. To make our analysis easily accessible and user-friendly, we will create a dashboard. This dashboard will serve as a centralized hub, presenting all suggested analyses in a straightforward manner. Users will be able to gain a quick overview of the data and base their judgments on the key findings presented in the dashboard.


6. Our project scope encompasses a comprehensive examination of parental leave policies across various companies. We will categorize leaves as paid or unpaid and distinguish between maternity and paternity leave. The scope also involves identifying the top fifteen companies offering parental leave based on the duration provided. Our analysis will focus on understanding the distribution of leaves, detecting any disparities, and identifying industry-specific trends. We emphasize the importance of gathering data from a diverse range of companies to ensure a holistic understanding of parental leave policies.

## Conclusion
Analysis of parental leave policies shows that there are big differences in how much time off mothers and fathers get. Usually, moms get more and can take longer breaks than dads. Interestingly, the tech industry is doing well in offering good parental leave benefits.
To fix this, it's important to have fair rules that help both men and women balance their work and family life. Companies should aim to give both moms and dads paid time off, and the amount of time should be similar. When businesses take more inclusive steps like this, it helps make a workplace that supports and treats everyone equally.
